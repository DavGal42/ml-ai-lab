# ML / AI Lab

A centralized repository for learning, experimenting, and building projects in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**.

This repository serves as a personal lab covering:
- Data analysis (NumPy, Pandas)
- Classical Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Deep Learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Experiments, notebooks, and full projects

The focus is on understanding fundamentals, experimenting freely, and gradually building production-quality projects.

## Folder Overview

### `fundamentals/`
Core concepts and basic usage of essential libraries.  
Focus: correctness, clarity, and understanding.

### `classical-ml/`
Traditional machine learning algorithms implemented using scikit-learn.

### `deep-learning/`
Neural network implementations using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

### `mlops/`
End-to-end MLOps workflows, automation scripts, and infrastructure-related examples

### `projects/`
Complete, well-documented projects suitable for demonstration or academic use.  
Each project contains its own `README.md`.

### `utils/`
Reusable helper functions shared across the repository.

### `data/`
Datasets used across experiments and projects.
- `raw/` – original, untouched data
- `processed/` – cleaned and transformed data
- `synthetic/` – generated data for testing

### `docs/`
Conceptual explanations, learning notes, and long-term plans.

## Goals

- Build strong ML and AI fundamentals
- Practice clean project structure and documentation
- Experiment freely and iterate quickly
- Prepare a solid base for MLOps-oriented projects
